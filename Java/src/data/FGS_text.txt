The Flight Guided System consists of a FGS System, a Side, and a Bus.
The FGS System components are Left FGS, Right FGS, LR Bus, and RL Bus
Side has ports Transfer Switch, Primary Side, Pilot Flying, Bus In and CLK.
Bus has ports Left, Right, and CLK.
Left FGS instantiates a Side.
Right FGS instantiates a Side.
LR instantiates a Bus.
RL instantiates a Bus.
Pilot Flying exports a boolean value.
Bus In imports a boolean input.
Left FGS is connected to LR using the ports Pilot Flying and Left.
RL is connected to Left FGS using the ports Left and Bus In.
LR is connected to Right FGS using the ports Right and Bus In.
Right FGS is connected to RL using the ports Pilot Flying and Right.
