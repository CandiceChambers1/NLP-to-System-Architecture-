The FGS consists of a FGS System, a Side and a Bus.
The FGS System consists of internal components: Left FGS, Right FGS, LR Bus and RL Bus.
The Side consists of ports : Transfer Switch, Primary Side, Pilot Flying, Bus In and CLK.
The Bus consists of ports : Left, Right and CLK.
The Left FGS instantiates a Side.
Right FGS instantiates a Side.
The LR instantiates a Bus.
The RL instantiates a Bus.
The Pilot Flying exports a boolean value.
The Bus In imports a boolean input.
The Left FGS is connected to LR by the ports Pilot Flying and Left.
The RL is connected to Left FGS by the ports Left and Bus In.
The LR is connected to Right FGS by the ports Right and Bus In.
The Right FGS is connected to RL by the ports Pilot Flying and Right.
