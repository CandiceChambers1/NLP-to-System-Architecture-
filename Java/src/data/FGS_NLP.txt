FGS consists FGS_SYSTEM , SIDE , and BUS.
FGS_SYSTEM consists internal_components : LEFT_FGS , RIGHT_FGS , LR_BUS , and RL_BUS.
SIDE consists port_components TRANSFER_SWITCH , PRIMARY_SIDE , PILOT_FLYING , BUS_IN and CLK.
BUS consists port_components LEFT , RIGHT , and CLK.
LEFT_FGS instantiates SIDE.
RIGHT_FGS instantiates SIDE.
LR instantiates BUS.
RL instantiates BUS.
PILOT_FLYING exports Boolean value.
BUS_IN imports Boolean input.
LEFT_FGS connected to LR port_components PILOT_FLYING and LEFT.
RL connected to LEFT_FGS port_components LEFT and BUS_IN.
LR connected to RIGHT_FGS port_components RIGHT and BUS_IN.
RIGHT_FGS connected to RL port_components PILOT_FLYING and RIGHT.
