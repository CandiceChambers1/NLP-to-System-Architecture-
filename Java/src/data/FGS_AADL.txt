The FGS_System consists of L_FGS, R_FGS, LR_Bus, RL_Bus, CLK_ONE, CLK_TWO, CLK_THREE, CLK_FOUR and environment.
L_FGS supplies Left_Pilot_Flying_Side to LR_Bus.
LR_Bus supplies Left_Pilot_Flying to R_FGS.
R_FGS supplies Left_Pilot_Flying_Side to RL_Bus.
RL_Bus supplies Left_Pilot_Flying to L_FGS.
The L_FGS imports TS_Bool_L from environment.
The L_FGS imports PS_Bool_L from environment.
The R_FGS imports TS_Bool_L from environment.
The R_FGS imports PS_Bool_L from environment.
CLK_ONE supplies temporal value to L_FGS.
CLK_TWO supplies temporal value to LR_Bus.
CLK_THREE supplies temporal value to R_FGS.
CLK_FOUR supplies temporal value to RL_Bus.
