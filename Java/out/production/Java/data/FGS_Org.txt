The FGS System consists of four components: the Left Side FGS, the Right Side FGS, an LR Bus, and an RL Bus.
LR Bus establishes connection between Left Side FGS and Right Side FGS.
The LR Bus takes input from CLK2.
RL Bus establishes connection between Left Side FGS and Right Side FGS.
The RL Bus takes input from CLK4.
The Left Side FGS accepts as input a boolean value of Left Transfer Switch and Left Primary Side.
The Left Side FGS takes input from a synchronous clock CLK1.
The Right Side FGS accepts as input a boolean value of Right Transfer Switch and Right Primary Side.
The Right Side FGS accepts input from a synchronous clock CLK3.
