Bus_12 takes input from Side_1_Status.
Bus_21 connects Side_2 with Side_1.
Bus_21 takes input from clock CLK_21.
Side_1 accepts Manual_Selection, Side_1SubSystem_Status, and Side2SubSystem_Status as input.
Side_1 accepts a input boolean value Side_1_Failed and Primary_Side as input.
Side_1 takes input from clock CLK_1.
Side_1 input signal is the Side_2_Status.
Side_1 generates Side_1_Status as an output.
Side_2 accepts Manual_Selection, Side_1SubSystem_Status, and Side2SubSystem_Status as input.
Side_2 accepts a input boolean value, Side_2_Failed and Primary_Side as input.
Side_2 takes Side_1_Status as input.
