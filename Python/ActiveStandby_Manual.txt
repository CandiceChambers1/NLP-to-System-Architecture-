The ASS consists of an Active Standby System, a Side, a Sub Demux, a Side Mux, a Side Demux, a Monitor, an Active Side
Logic and a Bus.
The Active Standby System consists of internal components: Side1, Side2, Bus12 and Bus21.
The Active Standby System consists of ports: Manual Selection, Primary Side, Side1Failed, Side2Failed,
Side1SubSystemStatus, and Side2SubSystemStatus.
The Side consists of internal components: Active Side Logic, Mon, Other, Other, This and This.
The Side consists of ports Manual Selection, ThisSideSubSystemStatus, OtherSideSubSystemStatus, CLK, PrimarySide,
OtherSideStatus, ThisSideStatus and ThisSideFailed.
The Bus consists of ports: In, Out and CLK.
The Sub Demux consists of ports: SubSystemStatus, SubAStatus and SubNStatus.
The Side Mux consists of ports: Failed, Active, ThisSideFullyAvail, OtherSideFullyAvail and Status.
The Side DeMux consists of ports: Failed, Active, ThisSideFullyAvail, OtherSideFullyAvail and Status.
The Monitor consists of ports: ThisSideFullyAvail, OtherSideFullyAvail, ThisSideSubAStatus, ThisSideSubNStatus,
OtherSideSubAStatus and OtherSideSubNStatus.
The ActiveSideLogic consists of ports: ThisMonThisSideFullyAvail, ThisMonOtherSideFullyAvail, ThisSideActive,
OtherMonOtherSideFullyAvail, OtherMonThisSideFullyAvail, OtherSideFailed, ThisSideFailed, riseManualSelection,
OtherSideFailed and riseOtherSideActive.
